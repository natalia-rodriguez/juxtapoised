    <p> Hi there! My name is Natalia and I'm a recent computer science grad from Southwestern University near Austin,
        Texas. I'm 22 years old and have recently relocated to the big apple!
        I am really interested in front end development, data visualizations, and journalism. I've written for FastCompany, where I covered tech and wrote code tutorials for art installations inside of FastCo.Labs.
        Originally from Mexico, I immigrated to the States when I was 10 years old and moved around a lot. I attended over 17 schools in grade school!
        While in school, I also photographed and wrote for the University's newspaper, eventually becoming the Editor In Chief of our student magazine. These gigs have landed me interviews with Jane Goodall, the Tumblr White House Social, and to conferences with National Geographic on the other side of the country.
        I'm also the founder of the "Real People Real Beauty Campaign", a movement for positive body image.</p> <br>
        <p>In my free time, I like to make data visualizations, much like the one above. Actually, that little guy upstairs is all yours if you want it. I made it easy to implement it so that you only have to put your resume items on a .csv file in google sheets and download the source code here. Let me know how you enjoy it!
        I sit on the board of trustees at Anita Borg Institute, the leading non-profit promoting diversity in technology, and am always really thrilled to hear any feedback on what we can be doing to better serve the cause.
        Feel free to contact me about stories or coding engagements here. Also, thanks for reading this far! Here's a randomized quote from my stack of favorites:</p><br>
